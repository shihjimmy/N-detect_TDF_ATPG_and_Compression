# **Introduction:**
- Implementation and evaluation of N-detect Transition Delay Fault (TDF) ATPG, focusing on Launch-On-Shift (LOS) mode.
- Our primary goal is to improve test quality and efficiency in VLSI circuits by detecting faults multiple times (N-detect) and applying test compression techniques.

## **1. N-detect TDF ATPG Implementation:**
   - **Purpose:** Enhance fault coverage by detecting each fault multiple times.
   - **Technique:** Utilizes the LOS mode to generate test patterns.
   - **Benefits:** Improved test quality and increased fault detection sensitivity.

## **2. Static Test Compression (STC):**
   - **Objective:** Reduce the number of test patterns and test data volume without compromising fault coverage.
   - **Method:** Applies compression techniques to the static test patterns generated by ATPG.
   - **Advantages:** Reduces test time and storage requirements, leading to cost savings.

## **3. Dynamic Test Compression (DTC):**
   - **Objective:** Further compress test data dynamically during the testing process.
   - **Technique:** Adjusts the compression ratio based on real-time analysis of test data.
   - **Benefits:** Enhances the efficiency of test data application and reduces overall testing time.

## **4. Evaluation and Comparison:**
   - **Metrics:** Fault coverage, test length, and run time are the key metrics used for evaluation.
   - **Scenarios:** Comparison between test results with and without applying STC and DTC.
   - **Findings:** 
     - Applying N-detect ATPG significantly increases fault coverage.
     - STC and DTC effectively reduce test data volume and test length.
     - The combination of N-detect ATPG and compression techniques provides a balanced approach to improving test quality and efficiency.
 
## HOW TO RUN:

### Generare the pattern of TDF ATPG w/ and w/o test compression, DTC/STC only, and 8-detect TDF ATPG w/ and w/o test compression  
./run (or you may type: bash run)

### Apply TDF ATPG w/ and w/o test compression
check_FC.sh            
### Apply TDF ATPG w/ and w/o test compression and print their difference
check_TL.sh                
### Apply only DTC/STC to all sample circuit and print the difference
check_DTC_STC.sh         
### Apply n-detect TDF ATPG from n = 1 to 8 w/ and w/o test compression and print their difference
check_Ndet.sh            

### More precisely, you can simply type the following command to operate our TDF ATPG in /src, for example:
./atpg -tdfatpg ../sample_circuits/c17.ckt > ../tdf_patterns/c17.pat
### You can use a flag "-compression" to do the compression;  otherwise, we will not:
./atpg -tdfatpg -compression ../sample_circuits/c17.ckt > ../tdf_patterns/c17.pat
### Only DTC/STC is okay by using flag -DTC/-STC:
./atpg -tdfatpg -STC ../sample_circuits/c17.ckt > ../tdf_patterns/c17.pat
### For n-detect, you can type "-ndet number" for the number N.  
>The flag (e.g. -ndet) is followed by the number of detection (e.g. number=N).    
>For example, if we want to specify 8 detection, we can simply type the following command:

./atpg -tdfatpg -ndet 8 ../sample_circuits/c17.ckt > ../tdf_patterns/c17.pat  

### The above commands can be used together like this: 
./atpg -tdfatpg -ndet 8 -compression ../sample_circuits/c17.ckt > ../tdf_patterns/c17.pat

## OTHER NOTICE:
> You may find the compression result of c6288 higher then uncompressed result, use STC only for this circuit may lead to better result.
